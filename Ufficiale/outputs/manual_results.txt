### QUESTION: check the setting of the dimmable lights 

### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic.
    6. Try to require also the names of entities
    
    
Here's the database schema:

Use these values for the 'name' property
Ceiling_light_1
Ceiling_light_5
Ceiling_light_4
Ceiling_light_2
Ceiling_light_3

These are the class labels: *don't invent other labels*
Dimmable_light
Brightness_sensor
Light
Boolean_sensor
Smoke_sensor

Here's some property values
{"setting": [20], "unit": ["percent"], "name": "Ceiling_light_1", "state": ["off"]}
{"name": "Ceiling_light_5", "state": ["off"]}
{"name": "Ceiling_light_4", "state": ["off"]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
(:Brightness_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:NamedIndividual)
(:Numeric_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Air_conditioner)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Togglable_device)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Occupancy_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)

### ANSWER PROMPT ###

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Don't mention Neo4j explicitly: describe the results in natual way. 
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.  
    

### CONTEXT ###

Answer the user question by describing the outputs provided by Neo4j: 
Original user question: "check the setting of the dimmable lights "
Result from Neo4j: []

GENERATED QUERY: MATCH (l:Dimmable_light) MATCH (s:Setting {value: l.setting}) RETURN s.unit, s.value AS setting

### ANSWER ###

It looks like there are no dimmable lights in the system. The result is an empty list, which means that none of the lights have a setting to adjust their brightness.

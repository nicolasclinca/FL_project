Which rooms in the 4th floor are currently occupied?

MATCH (r:Room)-[:LOCATED_ON]->(f:Floor{name: '4th'}) WHERE r.state = ['occupied'] RETURN r.name


### QUESTION: Are there any occupancy sensors active?

### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic.
    6. Try to require also the names of entities
    
    
Here's the database schema:

Use these values for the 'name' property
Occupancy_sensor_2
Occupancy_sensor_1
Occupancy_sensor_4
Occupancy_sensor_3
Occupancy_sensor_5

These are the class labels: *don't invent other labels*
Occupancy_sensor
Boolean_sensor
Smoke_sensor
Categorical_sensor
Numeric_sensor

Here's some property values
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_2", "value": [false]}
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_1", "value": [false]}
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_4", "value": [true]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
(:Occupancy_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Occupancy_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:NamedIndividual)
(:Boolean_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:NamedIndividual)

### ANSWER PROMPT ###

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Don't mention Neo4j explicitly: describe the results in natual way. 
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.  
    

### CONTEXT ###

Answer the user question by describing the outputs provided by Neo4j: 
Original user question: "Are there any occupancy sensors active?"
Result from Neo4j: []

GENERATED QUERY: MATCH (s:Occupancy_sensor) WHERE s.value CONTAINS true RETURN s.name

### ANSWER ###

The system does not have any active occupancy sensors registered.

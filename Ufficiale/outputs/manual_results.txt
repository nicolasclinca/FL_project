### QUESTION: Is the robot vacuum in the bathroom turned on?

### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic.
    6. Try to require also the names of entities
    
    
Here's the database schema:

These are the class labels: 
Robot_vacuum
Occupancy_sensor
Boolean_sensor

Use these values for the 'name' property
Robot_vacuum_1
Occupancy_sensor_1
Occupancy_sensor_2
Occupancy_sensor_4
Occupancy_sensor_3

Here's some property values
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_4", "value": [true]}
{"name": "Robot_vacuum_1", "state": ["off"]}
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_3", "value": [true]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
CONTAINS
LOCATED_IN
MEMBEROF
SUBCLASSOF

### ANSWER PROMPT ###

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Don't mention Neo4j explicitly: describe the results in natual way. 
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.  
    

### CONTEXT ###

Answer the user question by describing the outputs provided by Neo4j: 
Original user question: "Is the robot vacuum in the bathroom turned on?"
Result from Neo4j: [{'answer': False}]

GENERATED QUERY: MATCH (r:Robot_vacuum) RETURN r.state = ["on"] AS answer

### ANSWER ###

The system shows that the robot vacuum in the bathroom is not currently turned on.

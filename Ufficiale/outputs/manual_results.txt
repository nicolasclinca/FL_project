### QUESTION: where is the television 

### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic.
    6. Try to require also the names of entities
    
    
Here's the database schema:

These are the class labels: 
Television
Device
Temperature_sensor
Boolean_sensor
Sensor

Use these values for the 'name' property
Television_1
Living_room
Temperature_sensor_1
Lamp_1
Occupancy_sensor_1

Here's some property values
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_1", "value": [false]}
{"setting": [20], "unit": ["percent"], "name": "Lamp_1", "state": ["off"]}
{"unit": ["C"], "name": "Temperature_sensor_1", "value": [20]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
(:Appliance)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Robot_vacuum)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:NamedIndividual)
(:Air_conditioner)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:NamedIndividual)
(:Boolean_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Temperature_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:NamedIndividual)

### ANSWER PROMPT ###

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Don't mention Neo4j explicitly: describe the results in natual way. 
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.  
    

### CONTEXT ###

Answer the user question by describing the outputs provided by Neo4j: 
Original user question: "where is the television "
Result from Neo4j: [{'room_name': 'Living_room'}]

GENERATED QUERY: MATCH (t:Television {name: 'Television_1'})-[:LOCATED_IN]->(r) RETURN r.name AS room_name

### ANSWER ###

The TV is located in the Living room. It's a pretty convenient spot, I'd say! You can just relax and enjoy your favorite shows or sports games while sitting comfortably on the couch.

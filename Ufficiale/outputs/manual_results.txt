### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic. 
    
    
Here's the database schema:

Use these values for the 'name' property
Brightness_sensor_1
Ceiling_light_1
Ceiling_light_2

These are the class labels: *don't invent other labels*
Dimmable_light
Light
Brightness_sensor

Here's some property values
{'name': 'Brightness_sensor_1', 'value': ['low']}
{'name': 'Ceiling_light_1', 'setting': [20], 'state': ['off'], 'unit': ['percent']}
{'name': 'Ceiling_light_2', 'state': ['off']}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
(:NamedIndividual)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Dimmable_light)
(:Dimmable_light)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:NamedIndividual)
(:NamedIndividual)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Brightness_sensor)


### QUESTION: Give the name and the brightness level of all dimmable lights.

### QUERY: 

MATCH (n:NamedIndividual)-[:CONTAINS]->(d:Dimmable_light) RETURN n.name AS name, d.setting AS brightness_level

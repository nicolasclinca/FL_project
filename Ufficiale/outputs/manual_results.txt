### QUESTION: which sensor in the kitchen are true? 

### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic.
    6. Try to require also the names of entities
    
    
Here's the database schema:

These are the class labels: 

Use these values for the 'name' property
Kitchen
Temperature_sensor_1
Occupancy_sensor_3
Occupancy_sensor_5
Occupancy_sensor_4

Here's some property values
{"unit": ["C"], "name": "Temperature_sensor_1", "value": [20]}
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_3", "value": [true]}
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_5", "value": [false]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
LOCATED_IN
CONTAINS
SUBCLASSOF
MEMBEROF

### ANSWER PROMPT ###

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Don't mention Neo4j explicitly: describe the results in natual way. 
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.  
    

### CONTEXT ###

Answer the user question by describing the outputs provided by Neo4j: 
Original user question: "which sensor in the kitchen are true? "
Result from Neo4j: []

GENERATED QUERY: MATCH (k:Kitchen)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(s:Temperature_sensor_1), 
      (o:Occupancy_sensor_3)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(k)
WHERE o.value = true
RETURN s.name, o.name

### ANSWER ###

It looks like there are no sensors in the kitchen that are currently true. The result is an empty list, which means that none of the sensors in the kitchen have a status of "true".

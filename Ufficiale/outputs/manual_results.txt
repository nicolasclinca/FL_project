### QUESTION: where is the air conditioner 2? 

### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic.
    6. Try to require also the names of entities
    
    
Here's the database schema:

Use these values for the 'name' property
Air_conditioner_2
Air_conditioner_1
Ceiling_light_2
Lamp_2
Occupancy_sensor_2

These are the class labels: *don't invent other labels*
Air_conditioner
Appliance
Washing_machine
Coffee_machine
Humidity_sensor

Here's some property values
{'name': 'Air_conditioner_2', 'setting': [16], 'state': ['off'], 'unit': ['C']}
{'name': 'Air_conditioner_1', 'setting': [20], 'state': ['on'], 'unit': ['C']}
{'name': 'Ceiling_light_2', 'state': ['off']}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
(:Washing_machine)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:NamedIndividual)
(:Device)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:NamedIndividual)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)

### ANSWER PROMPT ###

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Don't mention Neo4j explicitly: describe the results in natual way. 
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.  
    

### CONTEXT ###

Answer the user question by describing the outputs provided by Neo4j: 
Original user question: "where is the air conditioner 2? "
Result from Neo4j: [{'r.name': 'Bedroom'}]

GENERATED QUERY: MATCH (a:Device {name: 'Air_conditioner_2'})-[:LOCATED_IN]->(r:Room) RETURN r.name

### ANSWER ###

The air conditioner 2 is located in the Bedroom. It seems to be installed there, but I don't have any information about its current status or whether it's working properly.

### QUESTION: Which appliances are in the bedroom ? 

### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic.
    6. Try to require also the names of entities
    
    
Here's the database schema:

These are the class labels: 
Appliance

Use these values for the 'name' property
Living_room
Bedroom
Washing_machine_1
Kitchen
Ceiling_light_1

Here's some property values
{"name": "Living_room"}
{"name": "Bedroom"}
{"name": "Kitchen"}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
CONTAINS
LOCATED_IN
SUBCLASSOF
MEMBEROF

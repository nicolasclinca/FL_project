### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic. 
    
    
Here's the database schema:

Use these values for the 'name' property
Brightness_sensor_1
Ceiling_light_1
Ceiling_light_2

These are the class labels: *don't invent other labels*
Dimmable_light
Brightness_sensor
Light

Here's some property values
{'name': 'Brightness_sensor_1', 'value': ['low']}
{'name': 'Ceiling_light_1', 'setting': [20], 'state': ['off'], 'unit': ['percent']}
{'name': 'Ceiling_light_2', 'state': ['off']}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
(:Dimmable_light)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Dimmable_light)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:NamedIndividual)
(:NamedIndividual)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Dimmable_light)


### QUESTION: What is the brightness level for all dimmable lights?

### QUERY: 

MATCH (d:Dimmable_light) RETURN d.setting

### ANSWER PROMPT ###

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.  
    

### CONTEXT ###

Answer the user question by describing the outputs provided by Neo4j: 
Original user question: "What is the brightness level for all dimmable lights?"
Result from Neo4j: [{'d.setting': [20]}, {'d.setting': [20]}, {'d.setting': [50]}]

QUERY: 

MATCH (d:Dimmable_light) RETURN d.setting

### ANSWER ###



The Neo4j query returned the brightness levels for dimmable lights as follows:  
- Two lights have a brightness level of **20**.  
- One light has a brightness level of **50**.  

Thus, the distinct brightness levels found are **20** and **50**. The results indicate that some dimmable lights are set to 20% brightness, while another is set to 50%.

### QUESTION: What is the brightness level for each dimmable lights?

MATCH (d:Dimmable_light) RETURN d.setting[0] AS brightness_level

QUERY: 

MATCH (d:Dimmable_light) RETURN d.setting[0] AS brightness_level

### ANSWER ###



The Neo4j query returned the brightness levels for dimmable lights in the database. The results show that there are dimmable lights set to **20% brightness** (appearing twice) and **50% brightness** (once). This indicates that some lights are adjusted to lower intensity, while others are set to a higher level. If you need further details, such as how many lights are at each level, let me know!

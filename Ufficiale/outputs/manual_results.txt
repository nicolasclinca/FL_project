### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic.
    6. Try to require also the names of entities
    
    
Here's the database schema:

Use these values for the 'name' property
Living_room
Coffee_machine_1
Humidity_sensor_1

These are the class labels: *don't invent other labels*
Settable_device
Togglable_device
Device

Here's some property values
{'name': 'Living_room'}
{'name': 'Coffee_machine_1', 'state': ['off']}
{'name': 'Humidity_sensor_1', 'unit': ['percent'], 'value': [40]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
(:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Settable_device)
(:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Device)
(:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Togglable_device)


### QUESTION: give me the setting of each settable device 

### QUERY: 

MATCH (s:Settable_device) RETURN s.name, s.state

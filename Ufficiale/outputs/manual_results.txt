### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic. 
    
    
Here's the database schema:

Use these values for the 'name' property
Lamp_1
Lamp_2
Lamp_3

These are the class labels: *don't invent other labels*
Light
Dimmable_light
Room

Here's some property values
{'name': 'Lamp_1', 'setting': [20], 'state': ['off'], 'unit': ['percent']}
{'name': 'Lamp_2', 'setting': [50], 'state': ['on'], 'unit': ['percent']}
{'name': 'Lamp_3', 'state': ['off']}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
(:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Light)
(:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Device)
(:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Brightness_sensor)


### QUESTION: How bright is Lamp 1? 

### QUERY: 

MATCH (l:Light {name: 'Lamp_1'}) RETURN l.setting

### ANSWER PROMPT ###

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Don't mention Neo4j explicitly: describe the results in natual way. 
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.  
    

### CONTEXT ###

Answer the user question by describing the outputs provided by Neo4j: 
Original user question: "How bright is Lamp 1? "
Result from Neo4j: [{'l.setting': [20]}]

QUERY: 

MATCH (l:Light {name: 'Lamp_1'}) RETURN l.setting

### ANSWER ###



Lamp 1 is currently set to a brightness level of 20.

### QUESTION: Give the brightness level of all dimmable lights.

### QUERY: 

MATCH (d:Dimmable_light) RETURN d.setting

Original user question: "Give the brightness level of all dimmable lights."
Result from Neo4j: [{'d.setting': [20]}, {'d.setting': [20]}, {'d.setting': [50]}]

QUERY: 

MATCH (d:Dimmable_light) RETURN d.setting

### ANSWER ###



The dimmable lights have brightness levels of 20 (for two lights) and 50 (for one light). This means two lights are currently set to a lower brightness level of 20, while one light is adjusted to a higher level of 50.

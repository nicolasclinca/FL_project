### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic. 
    
    
Here's the database schema:

Use these values for the 'name' property
Kitchen
Ceiling_light_1
Ceiling_light_2

These are the class labels: *don't invent other labels*
Light
Dimmable_light
Appliance

Here's some property values
{'name': 'Kitchen'}
{'name': 'Ceiling_light_1', 'setting': [20], 'state': ['off'], 'unit': ['percent']}
{'name': 'Ceiling_light_2', 'state': ['off']}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
(:Dimmable_light)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Light)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Light)

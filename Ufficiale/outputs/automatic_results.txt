Instructions Prompt

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic.
    6. Try to require also the names of entities
    
    

Answer Prompt

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Don't mention Neo4j explicitly: describe the results in natual way. 
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.

1) Query ID: 3

User Query:
How bright is Lamp 1? (ID: 3)

Generated Cypher query:
MATCH (l:Lamp {name: 'Lamp_1'})-[:LOCATED_IN]->(r:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(b:Brightness_sensor) RETURN b.setting[0] AS brightness

Neo4j outputs:
[]

Generated Answer:
It looks like there's no information about the brightness of Lamp 1. It seems that we don't have any data about its current brightness level. Maybe you can try checking the lamp's settings or asking someone who might know?

Expected answer:
Lamp 1 is set to 20% brightness.

Instructions Prompt

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic. 
    
    

Answer Prompt

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.

1) User Query:
Is the coffee machine on? (ID: 1)

Cypher query:
MATCH (cm:Coffee_machine {name: 'Coffee_machine_1'}) WHERE cm.state CONTAINS 'on' RETURN count(cm) > 0 AS is_on

Neo4j outputs:
[{'is_on': False}]

Answer:
The coffee machine is currently turned off. It's not in use at the moment. You might want to check if it needs a refill or turn it back on when you need your morning cup!

Expected answer:
The coffee machine is currently off.

2) User Query:
How bright is Lamp 1? (ID: 3)

Cypher query:
MATCH (l:Lamp {name: "Lamp_1"})-[:CONTAINS]->(s:Brightness_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(p:Place)<-[:CONTAINS]-(l2:Lamp) WHERE l = l2 RETURN s.state AS brightness

Neo4j outputs:
[]

Answer:
It looks like there's no information about a lamp called "Lamp 1" in the database. The empty list `[]` indicates that there are no results matching your query, which means we don't have any data about the brightness of Lamp 1.

Expected answer:
Lamp 1 is set to 20% brightness.

3) User Query:
Check the temperature setting of air conditioners. (ID: 9)

Cypher query:
MATCH (ac:Air_conditioner)-[:CONTAINS]->(ts:Temperature_sensor) WHERE ac.name IN ['Air_conditioner_1', 'Air_conditioner_2'] RETURN ts.unit, ac.setting

Neo4j outputs:
[]

Answer:
It looks like there are no air conditioners in the database with a temperature setting. The result is an empty list, indicating that no matching records were found. It's possible that you haven't added any data about air conditioners to the graph yet!

Expected answer:
Air conditioner 1 is set to 20°C, and Air conditioner 2 is set to 16°C.

4) User Query:
What is the current status of all lights? (ID: 10)

Cypher query:
MATCH (l:Light)-[:CONTAINS]->(bs:Brightness_sensor) RETURN l.name, bs.brightness

Neo4j outputs:
[]

Answer:
It looks like there are no lights in the system. The result set is empty, indicating that none of the lights have been recorded or monitored yet. If you'd like to add some lights to the system and get their current status, I can help with that!

Expected answer:
Ceiling light 3, Lamp 2 are on; Ceiling light 1, Ceiling light 2, Ceiling light 4, Ceiling light 5, Lamp 1, Lamp 3 are off.

5) User Query:
List all appliances in the kitchen. (ID: 22)

Cypher query:
MATCH (k:Kitchen {name: "Kitchen"})-[:CONTAINS]->(a:Appliance)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(k) RETURN a

Neo4j outputs:
[]

Answer:
It looks like there are no appliances listed in the kitchen. The result is an empty list, which means that there aren't any nodes representing appliances in the kitchen section of your database. If you'd like to add some appliances, I can help with that!

Expected answer:
Appliances in the kitchen include Coffee machine 1 and Oven 1.

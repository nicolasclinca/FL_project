Instructions Prompt

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic.
    6. Try to require also the names of entities
    
    

Answer Prompt

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Don't mention Neo4j explicitly: describe the results in natual way. 
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.

[1/2] User Query: How bright is Lamp 1? (ID: 3)

Filtered Schema:

Here's the database schema:

These are the class labels: 

Use these values for the 'name' property
Lamp_1
Ceiling_light_1
Lamp_2
Lamp_3
Brightness_sensor_1

Here's some property values
{"setting": [20], "unit": ["percent"], "name": "Lamp_1", "state": ["off"]}
{"setting": [50], "unit": ["percent"], "name": "Lamp_2", "state": ["on"]}
{"setting": [20], "unit": ["percent"], "name": "Ceiling_light_1", "state": ["off"]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
(:Brightness_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:NamedIndividual)
(:Television)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Appliance)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Numeric_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:NamedIndividual)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)



User Query:
How bright is Lamp 1? (ID: 3)

Generated Cypher query:
MATCH (l:Lamp_1)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(s:Brightness_sensor) RETURN s.setting

Neo4j outputs:
[]

Generated Answer:
It looks like there's no information about the brightness of Lamp 1. The result is empty, which means that we don't have any data about the brightness of that lamp. It's possible that it hasn't been measured or recorded yet!

Expected answer:
Lamp 1 is set to 20% brightness.

[2/2] User Query: Tell me the humidity reading. (ID: 7)

Filtered Schema:

Here's the database schema:

These are the class labels: 

Use these values for the 'name' property
Humidity_sensor_1
Smoke_sensor_1
Brightness_sensor_1
Occupancy_sensor_1
Washing_machine_1

Here's some property values
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_1", "value": [false]}
{"name": "Brightness_sensor_1", "value": ["low"]}
{"name": "Smoke_sensor_1", "value": [true]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
(:Numeric_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Brightness_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:NamedIndividual)
(:Appliance)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Boolean_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:NamedIndividual)
(:Occupancy_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:NamedIndividual)



User Query:
Tell me the humidity reading. (ID: 7)

Generated Cypher query:
MATCH (s:Humidity_sensor_1)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(n:NamedIndividual) RETURN s.value AS humidity_reading

Neo4j outputs:
[]

Generated Answer:
It looks like there is no humidity reading available. The system doesn't have any data on the current humidity level. It's possible that it hasn't been measured or recorded yet.

Expected answer:
The humidity sensor reads 40%.

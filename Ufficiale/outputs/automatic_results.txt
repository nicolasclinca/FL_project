Instructions Prompt

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic.
    6. Try to require also the names of entities
    
    

Answer Prompt

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Don't mention Neo4j explicitly: describe the results in natual way. 
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.

[1/3] User Query: Are there any occupancy sensors active? (ID: 6)

Filtered Schema:

Here's the database schema:

These are the class labels: 
Occupancy_sensor
Boolean_sensor
Smoke_sensor
Categorical_sensor
Numeric_sensor
Sensor
Brightness_sensor
Humidity_sensor
Temperature_sensor
Robot_vacuum

Use these values for the 'name' property
Occupancy_sensor_2
Occupancy_sensor_1
Occupancy_sensor_4
Occupancy_sensor_3
Occupancy_sensor_5

Here's some property values
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_5", "value": [false]}
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_2", "value": [false]}
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_3", "value": [true]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
CONTAINS
LOCATED_IN
MEMBEROF
SUBCLASSOF



User Query:
Are there any occupancy sensors active? (ID: 6)

Generated Cypher query:
MATCH (s:Occupancy_sensor) WHERE s.value = [true] RETURN s.name

Neo4j outputs:
[{'s.name': 'Occupancy_sensor_4'}, {'s.name': 'Occupancy_sensor_3'}]

Generated Answer:
Yes, there are two active occupancy sensors: **Occupancy_sensor_3** and **Occupancy_sensor_4**.

Expected answer:
Occupancy sensor 3 and Occupancy sensor 4 are currently active.

Smoke_sensor_1
Brightness_sensor_1
Occupancy_sensor_2

Here's some property values
{"unit": ["percent"], "name": "Humidity_sensor_1", "value": [40]}
{"name": "Smoke_sensor_1", "value": [true]}
{"name": "Brightness_sensor_1", "value": ["low"]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*

User Query:
Tell me the humidity reading. (ID: 7)

Generated Cypher query:
MATCH (s:Humidity_sensor) RETURN s.name, s.value

Neo4j outputs:
[{'s.name': 'Humidity_sensor_1', 's.value': [40]}]

Generated Answer:
The current humidity reading from the sensor named *Humidity_sensor_1* is **40%**.

Expected answer:
The humidity sensor reads 40%.

User Query:
What is the brightness sensor's reading? (ID: 8)

Generated Cypher query:
MATCH (b:Brightness_sensor) RETURN b.name, b.value

Neo4j outputs:
[{'b.name': 'Brightness_sensor_1', 'b.value': ['low']}]

Generated Answer:
The brightness sensor named *Brightness_sensor_1* is currently reporting a low reading.

Expected answer:
The brightness sensor is reading 'low'.

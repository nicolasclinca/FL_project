Instructions Prompt

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic.
    6. Try to require also the names of entities
    
    

Answer Prompt

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Don't mention Neo4j explicitly: describe the results in natual way. 
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.

[1/3] User Query: Is there any occupancy sensor indicating presence? (ID: 12)

Filtered Schema:

Here's the database schema:

These are the class labels: 
Occupancy_sensor
Boolean_sensor
Smoke_sensor
Categorical_sensor
Numeric_sensor
Brightness_sensor
Sensor
Humidity_sensor
Temperature_sensor
Robot_vacuum

Use these values for the 'name' property
Occupancy_sensor_2
Occupancy_sensor_4
Occupancy_sensor_3
Occupancy_sensor_1
Occupancy_sensor_5

Here's some property values
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_1", "value": [false]}
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_3", "value": [true]}
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_5", "value": [false]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
CONTAINS
LOCATED_IN
MEMBEROF
SUBCLASSOF



User Query:
Is there any occupancy sensor indicating presence? (ID: 12)

Generated Cypher query:
MATCH (s:Occupancy_sensor) WHERE s.value CONTAINS true RETURN s.name

Neo4j outputs:
[]

Generated Answer:
The system does not have any occupancy sensors that are currently indicating presence.

Expected answer:
Yes, Occupancy sensor 3 and Occupancy sensor 4 indicate presence.

[2/3] User Query: Check if the washing machine is running. (ID: 13)

Filtered Schema:

Here's the database schema:

These are the class labels: 
Washing_machine

Use these values for the 'name' property
Washing_machine_1
Occupancy_sensor_1
Occupancy_sensor_3
Occupancy_sensor_4
Coffee_machine_1

Here's some property values
{"name": "Coffee_machine_1", "state": ["off"]}
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_3", "value": [true]}
{"name": "Washing_machine_1", "state": ["on"]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
CONTAINS
LOCATED_IN
SUBCLASSOF
MEMBEROF



User Query:
Check if the washing machine is running. (ID: 13)

Generated Cypher query:
MATCH (w:Washing_machine {name: "Washing_machine_1"}) RETURN w.state[0] = "on" AS is_running

Neo4j outputs:
[{'is_running': True}]

Generated Answer:
The check confirms that the washing machine is currently running.

Expected answer:
The washing machine is currently on.

[3/3] User Query: What's the temperature setting on both air conditioners? (ID: 14)

Filtered Schema:

Here's the database schema:

These are the class labels: 
Air_conditioner
Temperature_sensor

Use these values for the 'name' property
Air_conditioner_1
Air_conditioner_2
Temperature_sensor_1
Humidity_sensor_1
Brightness_sensor_1

Here's some property values
{"name": "Brightness_sensor_1", "value": ["low"]}
{"unit": ["percent"], "name": "Humidity_sensor_1", "value": [40]}
{"setting": [20], "unit": ["C"], "name": "Air_conditioner_1", "state": ["on"]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
CONTAINS
LOCATED_IN
SUBCLASSOF
MEMBEROF



User Query:
What's the temperature setting on both air conditioners? (ID: 14)

Generated Cypher query:
MATCH (ac:Air_conditioner) RETURN ac.name, ac.setting

Neo4j outputs:
[{'ac.name': 'Air_conditioner_1', 'ac.setting': [20]}, {'ac.name': 'Air_conditioner_2', 'ac.setting': [16]}]

Generated Answer:
The temperature settings for both air conditioners are as follows: Air Conditioner 1 is set to 20 degrees, and Air Conditioner 2 is set to 16 degrees.

Expected answer:
Air conditioner 1 is set to 20°C, Air conditioner 2 is set to 16°C.

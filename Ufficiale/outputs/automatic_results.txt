Instructions Prompt

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic. 
    
    

Answer Prompt

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.

1) User Query:
List all appliances in the kitchen. (ID: 22)

Cypher query:


MATCH (r:Room {name: 'Kitchen'})-[:CONTAINS]->(a:Appliance) RETURN a.name

Neo4j outputs:
[{'a.name': 'Oven_1'}, {'a.name': 'Coffee_machine_1'}]

Answer:


The Neo4j query returned two appliances located in the kitchen:  
1. **Oven_1**  
2. **Coffee_machine_1**  

These are the names of the appliances listed in the kitchen.

Expected answer:
Appliances in the kitchen include Coffee machine 1 and Oven 1.

2) User Query:
What is the humidity level in the bedroom? (ID: 23)

Cypher query:


MATCH (r:Room {name: 'Bedroom'})-[:CONTAINS]->(s:Humidity_sensor) RETURN s.value, s.unit

Neo4j outputs:
[{'s.value': [40], 's.unit': ['percent']}]

Answer:


The humidity level in the bedroom is **40%**. The result indicates that the sensor value is 40, measured in **percent** units. This means the air in the bedroom currently has a humidity level of 40% relative humidity.

Expected answer:
The humidity level in the bedroom is 40%.

3) User Query:
Is there any light on in the bathroom? (ID: 24)

Cypher query:


MATCH (r:Room {name: 'Bathroom'})
MATCH (l:Light)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(r)
MATCH (d:Dimmable_light)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(r)
RETURN EXISTS([x IN l.state WHERE x = 'on']) OR EXISTS([x IN d.state WHERE x = 'on']) AS hasLightOn

Neo4j outputs:
[]

Answer:


The Neo4j query returned an empty result, indicating there is **no data** in the system that confirms any light is on in the bathroom. This could mean either:  
1. The system does not track lighting status for the bathroom.  
2. No entries exist for lights being activated in the bathroom.  

To confirm, you would need to check if the data model includes sensors or devices for bathroom lighting. If it does, ensure the query correctly references those nodes and relationships.

Expected answer:
No, all lights in the bathroom are off.

4) User Query:
Where are the temperature sensors located? (ID: 25)

Cypher query:


MATCH (t:Temperature_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(loc) RETURN loc.name

Neo4j outputs:
[{'loc.name': 'Kitchen'}]

Answer:


The temperature sensor is located in the **Kitchen**, as indicated by the result from the Neo4j query.

Expected answer:
Temperature sensors are located in the kitchen.

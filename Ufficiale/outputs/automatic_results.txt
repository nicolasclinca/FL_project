2) User Query:
Is the coffee machine on? (ID: 1)

Cypher query:
MATCH (cm:Coffee_machine {name: 'Coffee_machine_1'}) WHERE cm.state = ['on'] RETURN count(cm) > 0 AS is_on

Neo4j outputs:
[{'is_on': False}]

Answer:
The coffee machine is currently turned off. It's not functioning at the moment, so you won't be able to get a cup of coffee from it.

Expected answer:
The coffee machine is currently off.

3) User Query:
Check the oven's temperature setting. (ID: 2)

Cypher query:
MATCH (o:Oven {name: 'Oven_1'}) RETURN o.setting

Neo4j outputs:
[{'o.setting': [180]}]

Answer:
The oven's current temperature setting is set to 180 degrees. It looks like someone has already adjusted it to a nice, toasty level!

Expected answer:
The oven is set to 180°C.

4) User Query:
How bright is Lamp 1? (ID: 3)

Cypher query:
MATCH (l:Lamp {name: 'Lamp_1'}) RETURN l.setting[0] AS brightness

Neo4j outputs:
[]

Answer:
It looks like there's no information about a lamp called "Lamp 1" in the database. The empty list `[]` indicates that there are no results matching your query, which means we don't have any data about the brightness of Lamp 1.

Expected answer:
Lamp 1 is set to 20% brightness.

5) User Query:
What is the value on the temperature sensor? (ID: 4)

Cypher query:
MATCH (t:Temperature_sensor {name: 'Temperature_sensor_1'}) RETURN t.value

Neo4j outputs:
[{'t.value': [20]}]

Answer:
The temperature sensor has a reading of 20 degrees.

Expected answer:
The temperature sensor reads 20°C.

#########################

6) User Query:
Is the smoke sensor detecting smoke? (ID: 5)

Cypher query:
MATCH (s:Smoke_sensor {name: 'Smoke_sensor_1'}) WHERE s.value[0] = true RETURN s.name

Neo4j outputs:
[{'s.name': 'Smoke_sensor_1'}]

Answer:
The smoke sensor is indeed detecting smoke. The result shows that there's a smoke sensor named "Smoke_sensor_1" that has detected smoke, which suggests that it's currently active and alerting for smoke presence.

Expected answer:
The smoke sensor is currently detecting smoke.

#########################

7) User Query:
Are there any occupancy sensors active? (ID: 6)

Cypher query:
MATCH (s:Occupancy_sensor)-[:IS_ACTIVE]->() OR MATCH (s:Occupancy_sensor {value: [True]}) RETURN s.name

Neo4j outputs:
[]

Answer:
There are no occupancy sensors currently active. The result set is empty, indicating that none of the occupancy sensors in the database are currently active.

Expected answer:
Occupancy sensor 3 and Occupancy sensor 4 are currently active.

#########################

8) User Query:
Tell me the humidity reading. (ID: 7)

Cypher query:
MATCH (h:Humidity_sensor {name: 'Humidity_sensor_1'}) RETURN h.value[0]

Neo4j outputs:
[{'h.value[0]': 40}]

Answer:
The current humidity reading is 40%. The system has successfully retrieved and reported the humidity value.

Expected answer:
The humidity sensor reads 40%.

#########################

9) User Query:
What is the brightness sensor's reading? (ID: 8)

Cypher query:
MATCH (b:Brightness_sensor {name: 'Brightness_sensor_1'})-[:LOCATED_IN]->(n) OPTIONAL MATCH (b)-[:HAS_VALUE]->(v) WHERE v.value = 'low' RETURN b.name, v.value AS reading

Neo4j outputs:
[{'b.name': 'Brightness_sensor_1', 'reading': None}]

Answer:
It looks like the brightness sensor hasn't sent any readings yet. The output shows that there is a brightness sensor named "Brightness_sensor_1", but its current reading is unknown or not available. It's like trying to check the weather forecast for today, but it's still too early in the morning and no updates have been received yet!

Expected answer:
The brightness sensor is reading 'low'.

#########################

10) User Query:
Check the temperature setting of air conditioners. (ID: 9)

Cypher query:
MATCH (ac:Air_conditioner)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(n) WHERE n.name IN ['Air_conditioner_1', 'Air_conditioner_2'] OPTIONAL MATCH (ac)<-[r]-(s:Setting) RETURN ac.name, s.setting AS setting

Neo4j outputs:
[]

Answer:
It looks like there are no air conditioners in the database with a specified temperature setting. The result is an empty list, indicating that no matching records were found. It's possible that you need to add more data or relationships to your graph to answer this question.

Expected answer:
Air conditioner 1 is set to 20°C, and Air conditioner 2 is set to 16°C.

11) User Query:
What is the current status of all lights? (ID: 10)

Cypher query:
MATCH (l:Light) RETURN l.name, l.status

Neo4j outputs:
[{'l.name': 'Ceiling_light_3', 'l.status': None}, {'l.name': 'Ceiling_light_2', 'l.status': None}, {'l.name': 'Ceiling_light_5', 'l.status': None}, {'l.name': 'Ceiling_light_4', 'l.status': None}, {'l.name': 'Lamp_1', 'l.status': None}, {'l.name': 'Lamp_3', 'l.status': None}, {'l.name': 'Ceiling_light_1', 'l.status': None}, {'l.name': 'Lamp_2', 'l.status': None}]

Answer:
It looks like the current status of all lights is that they are currently unknown or not available. All of the lights, including Ceiling_light_3, Ceiling_light_2, Ceiling_light_5, Ceiling_light_4, Lamp_1, Lamp_3, Ceiling_light_1, and Lamp_2, have a status of None, indicating that their current state is not known or has not been reported.

Expected answer:
Ceiling light 3, Lamp 2 are on; Ceiling light 1, Ceiling light 2, Ceiling light 4, Ceiling light 5, Lamp 1, Lamp 3 are off.

Instructions Prompt

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic.
    6. Try to require also the names of entities
    
    

Answer Prompt

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Don't mention Neo4j explicitly: describe the results in natual way. 
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.

[1/3] User Query: Check if there is any smoke detected in the kitchen. (ID: 36)

Filtered Schema:

Here's the database schema:

These are the class labels: 

Use these values for the 'name' property
Smoke_sensor_1
Kitchen
Humidity_sensor_1
Air_conditioner_2
Air_conditioner_1

Here's some property values
{"name": "Kitchen"}
{"name": "Smoke_sensor_1", "value": [true]}
{"setting": [16], "unit": ["C"], "name": "Air_conditioner_2", "state": ["off"]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
LOCATED_IN
CONTAINS
MEMBEROF
SUBCLASSOF



User Query:
Check if there is any smoke detected in the kitchen. (ID: 36)

Generated Cypher query:
MATCH (s:Smoke_sensor_1)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(k:Kitchen) WHERE s.value CONTAINS true RETURN true

Neo4j outputs:
[]

Generated Answer:
The system checked for any smoke detection events in the kitchen and found none. There are no active smoke alerts in that area at this time.

Expected answer:
Yes, the smoke sensor in the kitchen is currently detecting smoke.

[2/3] User Query: What are the active sensors in the study? (ID: 37)

Filtered Schema:

Here's the database schema:

These are the class labels: 

Use these values for the 'name' property
Occupancy_sensor_3
Occupancy_sensor_2
Occupancy_sensor_5
Occupancy_sensor_1
Occupancy_sensor_4

Here's some property values
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_5", "value": [false]}
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_1", "value": [false]}
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_3", "value": [true]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
LOCATED_IN
CONTAINS
MEMBEROF
SUBCLASSOF



User Query:
What are the active sensors in the study? (ID: 37)

Generated Cypher query:
MATCH (s:Occupancy_sensor) WHERE s.value = [true] RETURN s.name

Neo4j outputs:
[{'s.name': 'Occupancy_sensor_4'}, {'s.name': 'Occupancy_sensor_3'}]

Generated Answer:
The active sensors in the study are **Occupancy_sensor_4** and **Occupancy_sensor_3**.

Expected answer:
Occupancy sensor 4 is active in the study.

Instructions Prompt

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic.
    6. Try to require also the names of entities
    
    

Answer Prompt

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Don't mention Neo4j explicitly: describe the results in natual way. 
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.

[1/2] User Query: What is the state of the television? (ID: 0)

Filtered Schema:

Here's the database schema:

These are the class labels: 
Television

Use these values for the 'name' property
Television_1
Temperature_sensor_1
Occupancy_sensor_1
Living_room
Occupancy_sensor_5

Here's some property values
{"name": "Living_room"}
{"name": "Television_1", "state": ["on"]}
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_5", "value": [false]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
CONTAINS
LOCATED_IN
SUBCLASSOF
MEMBEROF



User Query:
What is the state of the television? (ID: 0)

Generated Cypher query:
MATCH (t:Television) RETURN t.name, t.state

Neo4j outputs:
[{'t.name': 'Television_1', 't.state': ['on']}]

Generated Answer:
The television named *Television_1* is currently in the **on** state.

Expected answer:
The television is currently on.

[2/2] User Query: Is the music set to high volume? (ID: 65)

Filtered Schema:

Here's the database schema:

These are the class labels: 

Use these values for the 'name' property
Brightness_sensor_1
Occupancy_sensor_1
Humidity_sensor_1
Occupancy_sensor_5
Ceiling_light_1

Here's some property values
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_5", "value": [false]}
{"unit": ["percent"], "name": "Humidity_sensor_1", "value": [40]}
{"name": "Occupancy_sensor_1", "value": [false]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
CONTAINS
LOCATED_IN
MEMBEROF
SUBCLASSOF



User Query:
Is the music set to high volume? (ID: 65)

Generated Cypher query:
MATCH (s) WHERE s.value = 'high' RETURN s.name

Neo4j outputs:
[]

Generated Answer:
No, there's no information in the system that the music is set to high volume.

Expected answer:
I am not aware of any music system in the home.

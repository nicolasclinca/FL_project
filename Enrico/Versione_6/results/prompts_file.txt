### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: nothing else. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties, relationships or objects: read the database schema.   
    3. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic. 
    
    
Here's the database schema:

Use these values for the 'name' property

Here's some property values

Each label has these properties
Label: `NamedIndividual` has ONLY these properties: ['setting', 'value', 'name', 'unit', 'state']
Label: `Room` has ONLY these properties: ['name']
Label: `Class` has ONLY these properties: ['name']

Use this SUBCLASSOF relationship schema
(:Dimmable_light)-[:SUBCLASSOF]->(:Light) 
(:Light)-[:SUBCLASSOF]->(:Togglable_device) 
(:Dimmable_light)-[:SUBCLASSOF]->(:Settable_device) 

These are the relationship types per labels
(:NamedIndividual)-[:CONTAINS]->(:NamedIndividual)
(:NamedIndividual)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:NamedIndividual)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:NamedIndividual)

### CHAT HISTORY ###

You are a helpful assistant.

Is the coffee machine on?

MATCH (cm:NamedIndividual {name: 'Coffee_machine_1'}) WHERE cm.state = ['on'] RETURN count(cm) > 0 AS is_on

Check the temperature setting of air conditioners.

MATCH (ac:NamedIndividual)-[:MEMBEROF]->(c:Class {name:'Air_conditioner'}) RETURN ac.setting

List all rooms with active occupancy sensors.

MATCH (r:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(os:NamedIndividual {value:[true]})-[:MEMBEROF]->(:Class{name:'Occupancy_sensor'}) RETURN r.name 

Which rooms contain dimmable lights?

MATCH (r:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(dl:NamedIndividual), (dl:NamedIndividual)-[:MEMBEROF]->(cls:Class{name:'Dimmable_light'}) RETURN r

List all appliances in the bathroom

MATCH (b:Room{name:'Bathroom'})-[:CONTAINS]->(n:NamedIndividual)-[:MEMBEROF]->(a:Class {name:'Appliance'}) RETURN n.name 

### ANSWER PROMPT ###

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the results of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these results in a natural way.
Please, be synthetic: read the results and explain them by answering to the user question.  
    

### CONTEXT ###

Answer the user question by describing the results provided by Neo4j: 
Original user question: "List me all lights which are on state on"
Result from Neo4j: []

### ANSWER ###

It looks like there aren't any lights that are currently in an 'on' state. The list of lights is empty, so it seems that none of the lights in the system are turned on right now.

### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: nothing else. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties, relationships or objects: read the database schema.   
    3. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic. 
    
    
Here's the database schema:

Use these values for the 'name' property
Occupancy_sensor_1
Occupancy_sensor_2
Occupancy_sensor_3

Here's some property values
{'name': 'Occupancy_sensor_1', 'value': [False]}
{'name': 'Occupancy_sensor_2', 'value': [False]}

Each label has these properties
Label: `NamedIndividual` has ONLY these properties: ['name', 'value', 'unit', 'setting', 'state']
Label: `Room` has ONLY these properties: ['name']
Label: `Class` has ONLY these properties: ['name']

Use this SUBCLASSOF relationship schema
(:Occupancy_sensor)-[:SUBCLASSOF]->(:Boolean_sensor) 
(:Boolean_sensor)-[:SUBCLASSOF]->(:Sensor) 
(:Numeric_sensor)-[:SUBCLASSOF]->(:Sensor) 

These are the relationship types per labels
(:NamedIndividual)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(:NamedIndividual)
(:NamedIndividual)-[:MEMBEROF]->(:Class)

### ANSWER PROMPT ###

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the results of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these results in a natural way.
Please, be synthetic: read the results and explain them by answering to the user question.  
    

### CHAT HISTORY ###

You are a helpful assistant.

Check the oven temperature setting.

MATCH (n:NamedIndividual {name: 'Oven'}) return n.setting

Is the coffee machine on?

MATCH (cm:NamedIndividual {name: 'Coffee_machine_1'}) WHERE cm.state = ['on'] RETURN count(cm) > 0 AS is_on

Check the temperature setting of air conditioners.

MATCH (ac:NamedIndividual)-[:MEMBEROF]->(c:Class {name:'Air_conditioner'}) RETURN ac.setting

What devices are currently off in the bedroom?

MATCH (d:NamedIndividual)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(r:Room {name: 'Bedroom'}) WHERE d.state=['off'] RETURN d.name

What devices are currently on in the kitchen?

MATCH (d:NamedIndividual)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(r:Room {name: 'Kitchen'}) WHERE d.state =['on'] RETURN d.name

Which rooms contain dimmable lights?

MATCH (r:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(dl:NamedIndividual), (dl:NamedIndividual)-[:MEMBEROF]->(cls:Class{name:'Dimmable_light'}) RETURN r

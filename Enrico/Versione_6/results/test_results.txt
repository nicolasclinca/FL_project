Answer:
It looks like there are no rooms in your database that have dimmable lights. The result is an empty list, which means that none of the rooms have been associated with dimmable lighting devices. If you'd like to add some dimmable lights to your space, I can help you update the database!

Dimmable lights are located in the bedroom and the study.

### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: nothing else. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties, relationships or objects: read the database schema.   
    3. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic. 
    
    
Here's the database schema:

Use these values for the 'name' property
Ceiling_light_4
Ceiling_light_3
Ceiling_light_2
Ceiling_light_5
Ceiling_light_1

Here's some property values
{'name': 'Ceiling_light_4', 'state': ['off']}
{'name': 'Ceiling_light_3', 'state': ['on']}

These are the relationship types per labels
(:Dimmable_light)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Light)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Brightness_sensor)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)

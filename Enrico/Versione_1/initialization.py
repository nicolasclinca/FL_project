### GRAPH SCHEMA ###

house_schema = """
    Node Labels and their primary properties (nodes often have multiple labels due to class hierarchy):
    Note: Ontology classes are prefixed with 'ns0__'. For example, a Room is labeled :ns0__Room.
    - ns0__Room: Represents locations. Examples: "Living_room", "Kitchen", "Bedroom", "Bathroom", "Study".

    Node Identification:
    - Individual entities (devices, rooms, sensors like 'Lamp_1', 'Kitchen') are nodes, each having a unique 'uri' property (e.g., "http://swot.sisinflab.poliba.it/home#Lamp_1").
    - These individual nodes are typically labeled with `:Resource` and `:owl__NamedIndividual`.
    - Some individuals, like Rooms, might also directly have their specific type label (e.g., a node for 'Kitchen' might be labeled `:ns0__Room`).
    - For other individuals (especially devices and sensors), their specific ontological type (e.g., Light, Temperature_sensor) might not be a direct label on the instance node. Their type is often defined by relationships (like `rdf:type`) to class nodes or inferred from the properties they possess.
    - The unique identifier for an entity (e.g., "Lamp_1", "Living_room") is the fragment part of its 'uri' (the part after '#').
    - To match a specific named individual like "Lamp_1", query its 'uri' property (e.g., `WHERE n.uri ENDS WITH '#Lamp_1'`). Do NOT assume specific type labels like `:ns0__Light` are present on these individual device/sensor nodes when matching them by URI.

    Relationship Types:
    - (Individual Device/Sensor)-[:ns0__located_in]->(Individual Room, e.g., node labeled :ns0__Room).
    - (Individual Room, e.g., node labeled :ns0__Room)-[:ns0__contains]->(Individual Device/Sensor).
    """  # schema con nodi e relazioni

example_schema = """
    Common Data Properties on Nodes (as per ontology mapping):
    Note: Data properties are also prefixed with 'ns0__'.
    - 'ns0__state': For ns0__Togglable_device instances, indicates if it's "on" or "off".
    - 'ns0__setting': For ns0__Settable_device instances, the current setting value.
    - 'ns0__unit': The unit for 'ns0__setting' or 'ns0__value' (e.g., "percent", "C").
    - 'ns0__value': For ns0__Sensor instances, the sensed value.

    Example Cypher Queries based on this schema:
    - To find if "Lamp_1" is on:
      MATCH (d) WHERE d.uri ENDS WITH "#Lamp_1" RETURN d.ns0__state AS state
    - To find the temperature setting of "Air_conditioner_1":
      MATCH (d) WHERE d.uri ENDS WITH "#Air_conditioner_1" RETURN d.ns0__setting AS setting, d.ns0__unit AS unit
    - To find what room "Lamp_1" is in:
      MATCH (d)-[:ns0__located_in]->(r:ns0__Room) WHERE d.uri ENDS WITH "#Lamp_1" RETURN r.uri AS room_uri
    - To list all devices in the "Kitchen":
      MATCH (r:ns0__Room)-[:ns0__contains]->(d) WHERE r.uri ENDS WITH "#Kitchen" RETURN d.uri AS device_uri, labels(d) AS types
    - To get the value of "Occupancy_sensor_3":
      MATCH (s) WHERE s.uri ENDS WITH "#Occupancy_sensor_3" RETURN s.ns0__value AS value

### QUERY PROMPT ###

zero_prompt = f"""
    You are an expert Cypher query generator.
    Your task is to generate a Cypher query that retrieves information from a Neo4j graph database to answer the user's question.
    The graph schema is as follows:

    """

instruction_prompt = f"""

    Instructions:
    - Only output a valid Cypher query.
    - Do not include any explanations, comments, or markdown formatting like ```cypher ... ```.
    - Ensure the query returns data that can directly answer the user's question.
    - When querying a specific named individual (e.g., "Lamp 1", "Kitchen"), match it using its `uri` property (e.g., `WHERE individual.uri ENDS WITH '#Lamp_1'`). Do NOT add specific type labels like `:ns0__Light` or `:ns0__Device` to the individual node in the MATCH pattern, as these individuals are primarily labeled `:owl__NamedIndividual`.
    - However, if you are matching a Room individual, you CAN use the `:ns0__Room` label (e.g., `(r:ns0__Room)`).
    - Data properties (like `ns0__state`, `ns0__setting`, `ns0__value`) are directly on these individual nodes. Refer to the schema to know which conceptual type has which properties. The base URI for individuals is typically 'http://swot.sisinflab.poliba.it/home'.

    """

example_prompt = f"""

    For example:
    User query: "Is Lamp 1 on?"
    Appropriate Cypher query: MATCH (d) WHERE d.uri ENDS WITH '#Lamp_1' RETURN d.ns0__state AS state

    User query: "What is the temperature in the kitchen?"
    Appropriate Cypher query: MATCH (s)-[:ns0__located_in]->(r:ns0__Room) WHERE s.uri ENDS WITH '#Temperature_sensor_1' AND r.uri ENDS WITH '#Kitchen' RETURN s.ns0__value AS value, s.ns0__unit AS unit
    (Alternative for "temperature in the kitchen" if a specific sensor isn't named: MATCH (r:ns0__Room)-[:ns0__contains]->(s:ns0__Temperature_sensor) WHERE r.uri ENDS WITH '#Kitchen' RETURN s.ns0__value, s.ns0__unit. This assumes Temperature_sensor_1 is a :ns0__Temperature_sensor, which might be a class node or an individual with that label if import was different. For now, prioritize matching individuals by URI if named.)

    User query: "Which devices are in the living room?"
    Appropriate Cypher query: MATCH (r:ns0__Room)-[:ns0__contains]->(d) WHERE r.uri ENDS WITH '#Living_room' RETURN d.uri AS device_uri

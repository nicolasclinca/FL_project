### QUESTION PROMPT ###

    Generate the Cypher query that best answers the user query.
    Follow these guidelines:

    1. Always output a syntactically correct Cypher query. 
    2. Use only the node labels, relationship types, and property keys provided in the schema.
    3. Use specific names only if explicitly mentioned in the question.
    4. Do not invent properties or overly specific details.
    5. Keep queries syntactically correct, simple, and readable.

    You are a helpful smart assistant.
    You'll receive the results of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these results in a natural way.
    Please, be synthetic: read the results and explain them by answering to the user question.  
    

 # QUESTION PROMPT 
    You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.
    
    Follow these guidelines:
    
    1. Always output a syntactically correct Cypher query and nothing else. 
    2. Use only the node labels, relationship types, and property keys provided in the schema.
    3. Use specific names only if explicitly mentioned in the question.
    4. Do not invent properties or overly specific details.
    5. Keep queries syntactically correct, simple, and readable.
    6. Access node properties using dot notation (e.g., `n.name`).
    
    
Here's the database schema:

These are values for the 'name' property
- Ceiling_light_5
- Ceiling_light_4
- Ceiling_light_1
- Ceiling_light_3
- Ceiling_light_2
- Lamp_3
- Lamp_1
- Lamp_2
- Occupancy_sensor_5
- Living_room

Each label has these properties
Label: `NamedIndividual` has ONLY these properties: ['setting', 'unit', 'value', 'state', 'name']
Label: `Room` has ONLY these properties: ['name']
Label: `Class` has ONLY these properties: ['name']

Examples per Label
Examples for `NamedIndividual` -> ['Ceiling_light_5', 'Ceiling_light_4', 'Ceiling_light_1', 'Ceiling_light_3', 'Ceiling_light_2', 'Lamp_3', 'Lamp_1', 'Lamp_2', 'Occupancy_sensor_5', 'Living_room']
Examples for `Room` -> ['Living_room', 'Bedroom', 'Kitchen', 'Bathroom', 'Study']
Examples for `Class` -> ['Light', 'Dimmable_light', 'Room', 'Brightness_sensor', 'Device', 'Settable_device', 'Air_conditioner', 'Appliance', 'Television', 'Robot_vacuum']

Here are all the available classes
- Light
- Dimmable_light
- Room
- Brightness_sensor
- Device
- Settable_device
- Air_conditioner
- Appliance
- Television
- Robot_vacuum

These are the relationship types per labels
- (:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(:NamedIndividual)
- (:NamedIndividual)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:NamedIndividual)
- (:Class)-[:SUBCLASSOF]->(:Class)
- (:NamedIndividual)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
- (:NamedIndividual)-[:CONTAINS]->(:NamedIndividual)
- (:NamedIndividual)-[:MEMBEROF]->(:Class)

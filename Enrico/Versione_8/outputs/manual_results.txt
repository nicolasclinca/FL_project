### CHAT HISTORY ###

You are a helpful assistant.

Which are the roles of the employees?

Which are the names of John's friends?

MATCH (f)-[:FRIEND]->(j:Person {name: 'John'}) RETURN f.name

Is there any user with age 38?

MATCH (u:User) WHERE u.age = 38 RETURN COUNT(u) > 0 AS user_exists

Which rooms in the 4th floor are currently occupied?

MATCH (r:Room)-[:LOCATED_ON]->(f:Floor{name: '4th'}) WHERE r.state = ['occupied'] RETURN r.name

### QUESTION PROMPT ###

You are an expert Cypher generator: your task is to generate Cypher query that best answers the user question.

Follow these guidelines:
    1. Write ONLY a syntactically correct Cypher query: NOTHING ELSE. 
    2. DO NOT invent properties: read the database schema.
    3. Use ONLY the relationships in the database.    
    4. Write the queries according to the schema 
    5. Keep the queries simple, readable and deterministic.
    6. Try to require also the names of entities
    
    
Here's the database schema:

Use these values for the 'name' property
Living_room
Occupancy_sensor_4
Occupancy_sensor_1
Occupancy_sensor_3
Occupancy_sensor_2

These are the class labels: *don't invent other labels*
Settable_device
Room
Occupancy_sensor
Togglable_device
Device

Here's some property values
{'name': 'Living_room'}
{'name': 'Occupancy_sensor_4', 'value': [True]}
{'name': 'Occupancy_sensor_1', 'value': [False]}

These are the relationships: *don't invent other relationships*
(:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Settable_device)
(:Settable_device)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)
(:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Device)
(:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Togglable_device)
(:Togglable_device)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Room)


### QUESTION: which rooms contain a settable device? 

### QUERY: MATCH (r:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(s:Settable_device) RETURN r.name

### ANSWER PROMPT ###

You are a helpful smart assistant.
You'll receive the outputs of the query, written in Cypher language: explain these outputs in a natural way.
Don't mention Neo4j explicitly: describe the results in natual way. 
Please, be synthetic: read the outputs and explain them by answering to the user question.  
    

### CONTEXT ###

Answer the user question by describing the outputs provided by Neo4j: 
Original user question: "which rooms contain a settable device? "
Result from Neo4j: [{'r.name': 'Bedroom'}, {'r.name': 'Bedroom'}, {'r.name': 'Study'}, {'r.name': 'Kitchen'}, {'r.name': 'Living_room'}, {'r.name': 'Bedroom'}]

QUERY: MATCH (r:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(s:Settable_device) RETURN r.name

### ANSWER ###

The rooms that contain a settable device are the Bedroom, Bedroom, Study, Kitchen, Living room, and another Bedroom. It looks like there's more than one bedroom with this feature!
